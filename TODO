Build:
 Need to do a fair bit of research on this. Needs to fit ITIL model

# Problem 
Similar to handover - Needs to include percentage of completion.
Look into other projects see what they offer
More ITIL research

# Handover
Similar to Operations handover

# Asset list 
This will probably be one of the biggest bits of work. Will most likely be in new branch

# Customer Incident reporting
Maybe - although this is more based around being for NOC users over a FL / Support team

# Home Page
Enough said

# Authentication Model
This will be huge as these is lots of custom accesses. Look into the flexibility of the cancan gem...
